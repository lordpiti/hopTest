# UK Parliament - Software Engineering

## Home exercise

Notes:

* The Angular app has been set up to use port 5001 as default for the BE API, which is set on the launchSettings for the app by using dotnet run. If you want to change the port to be used by the Angular app, it can be done through the environment.ts file
* The Angular app starts on the page where I developed the exercise, so I have changed the routing to do so. The old home page is still available on the route /home
* As I didn't know if it was allowed, I haven't used any library like Bootstrap or Material for the UI. All CSS have been created from scratch (This way I also prove some basic SASS knowledge)
* I tried to avoid modifying as much as possible the code which was provided and added all unit tests that I thought were needed for both BE and FE
